  <h2>What Cooperative stands for?</h2>
  <p>
    We are in the process of registering a non-profit cooperative (gemeinn√ºtzige Genossenschaft) involving all the
    Prachtsaalians. It will open new
    possibilities for communities meeting at Prachtsaal and the space itself. In addition to our ateliers, and
    our daily art practice, we will provide a venue hosting regular concerts and performances, a gallery
    with constantly rotating exhibitions, and a space for workshops and education.
